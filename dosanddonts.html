				When conducting research, it is important to gather lots of information quickly 
				and then sort through it later. If you analyze each source as you find it, you 
				will lose track of the main idea and get lost and discouraged. One trick that I 
				use is to open a word doc and call it sources, I then open a browser and type in 
				a basic web search of my topic. I click on links that look like they could work 
				for my paper and then read the first paragraph and check the length of the source. 
				If I have not eliminated the source as an option after reading the first paragraph, 
				I add it to my source document and move on to the next source. If my topic is 
				somewhat dynamic, or I already have an idea of how I want to break the paper into 
				sections, then I will add a brief header explaining each section of sources. For 
				example, I used “basic radiocarbon dating info”, “flaws”, and “uses” as headers 
				in my sources document. By conducting research in this way, you can quickly get a 
				big picture of your topic and glean lots of information that can be used in your 
				paper later. (<a href="#Top">Go to top</a>)

				When drafting your paper or a bibliography I would recommend writing your 
				thoughts as they come, without editing. This brain dump type of writing can be 
				really helpful when trying to write a coherent and well-structured paper. If 
				you are able to see the big picture of your topic and you write those thoughts 
				quickly without dealing with verbiage and syntax, then you usually are able to 
				relate each part of the paper to the overarching theme better. If you get caught 
				up in the details, then you can lose track of the main idea, and the sections 
				won’t flow together as well. I find it most helpful when I am able to write the 
				entire paper draft, or at least a major section, in one sitting. After drafting 
				the paper, or a section, you can go back and analyze your verbiage, grammar, and 
				sentence structure. (<a href="#Top">Go to top</a>)

				When you start to write your paper draft, I would recommend summarizing each 
				source you plan to use. Your teacher may already have you do this in an 
				annotated bibliography, but if he/she doesn’t require that you do this, I would 
				still highly recommend this step. If you summarize what your source is saying 
				in your own words, you will often emphasize the parts of the source that relate 
				to your paper. If you have a list of summaries of your sources, these paragraphs 
				can usually be put directly into your paper, and then edited to fit their position 
				in the paper. By writing this way, you can save yourself a lot of mental work, 
				while enhancing the credibility of your paper. Usually when you choose a source, 
				it is because the source is making a point that you already want to emphasize 
				in your paper. If you can use their ideas, and just change the wording to emphasize 
				your point, then you have saved yourself a lot of work. Just remember to be careful 
				to paraphrase and summarize carefully and cite your sources accurately.

				If possible, avoid using the Microsoft Word app for Chromebooks. I used 
				this app for much of my paper and annotated bibliography and lost a lot of 
				data. The app is unpredictable and can crash unexpectedly. Even if you are 
				using the adage, “save early and save often”, you can still lose data. During 
				the process of writing my annotated bibliography, my Word app crashed. I 
				thought it wouldn’t be a big deal because I had saved recently. Unfortunately, 
				I tried to open the file and it had been corrupted. None of the tools available 
				online could recover the data and I lost about 11 pages of writing. This was 
				not a onetime occurrence as it happened with other documents on other occasions. 
				If you must use the Microsoft Word app for Chromebook, I would recommend doing 
				a save as rather than just a save very often to avoid losing data.

				Try to avoid overanalyzing your sources. It is important to know the main 
				point of each source, but if you read every word meticulously, then you are 
				going to get bogged down. Once I have reached the point in my project where 
				I am summarizing the sources, I will re-read the first paragraph, read the 
				last paragraph, and skim the rest. I am usually looking for key words that 
				relate to my topic, and then I read the surrounding paragraph. If you have 
				gathered lots of sources quickly without reading them (as I would recommend), 
				then you should find that a lot of the sources you have, cannot be used. As 
				long as you have gathered enough sources in the research stage, you should 
				still be left with a decent sized pool of resources. Just remember that your 
				goal is to convey an overarching conglomeration of ideas to emphasize a central 
				idea, not become an expert in any field overnight. (<a href="#Top">Go to top</a>)
