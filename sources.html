				Cohn is a student at MSU studying Archaeology. This article 
				illustrates the way that radiocarbon dating is being presented 
				to college students. The fact that Cohn is able to identify 
				flaws in the radiocarbon dating method as a student but is 
				not presented with solutions illustrates the shortcomings of 
				radiocarbon dating in academia. This article illustrates an 
				important aspect of how radiocarbon dating is used, not only in 
				scientific fields, but also in academia. The radiocarbon dating 
				method is being taught to college students as a primary dating 
				method for determining accurate dates for organic material, 
				and yet the students are able to identify inconsistencies of 
				the method. Either these inconsistencies are presented by the 
				professors or they are recognized readily by the students. 
				However, the students are not provided with solutions to these 
				flaws in radiocarbon dating. (<a href="#Top">Go to top</a>)
